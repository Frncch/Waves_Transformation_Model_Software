# Waves_Transformation__Model_Software
A depth-integrated, weighting-averaging residual method-based model to study shallow-water lee-side waves at obstacles

This software permits to compute shallow-water lee-side waves at obstacles in open channels. The software is based on the Vertically-Averaged and Moment (VAM) equations model incorporating mayor improvements to tackle waves transformation beyond obstacles. The VAM model uses the weighted residual method to account for the non-hydrostaticity and non-uniformity of flow as well as accurate predictors for the depth-integrated Reynolds stress terms.
